## 🏗️ Architecture & Code Quality

### Clean Architecture
```
cmd/server/main.go          → Entry point
internal/
  ├── config/               → Configuration management
  ├── db/                   → Database connection
  ├── models/               → Data models (13 files)
  ├── services/             → Business logic
  ├── handlers/             → HTTP handlers
  ├── middleware/           → Auth, CORS, etc.
  ├── routes/               → Route definitions
  └── utils/                → Utilities (JWT, password)
```

### Key Design Patterns
- **Service Layer Pattern** - Business logic separated from HTTP
- **Repository Pattern** - GORM as data access layer
- **Middleware Chain** - Auth, CORS, logging
- **DTO Pattern** - Separate input/output structures
- **Error Handling** - Consistent error responses

### Security Features
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT with short-lived access tokens
- Refresh token rotation
- CORS configured
- SQL injection protection (GORM parameterization)
- Role-based access control
- Input validation

2. **Example: User Lists**
```go
// 1. Create internal/services/user_list_service.go
// 2. Create internal/handlers/user_list_handler.go
// 3. Add routes:
//    POST /lists - Create list
//    GET /lists - Get user's lists
//    POST /lists/:id/items - Add movie to list
```

3. **For Real-Time Features (Chat)**

## 💡 Tips for Extending

1. **Always follow the existing patterns**
2. **Services contain business logic, not handlers**
3. **Use middleware for cross-cutting concerns**
4. **Keep handlers thin - just request/response**
5. **Use transactions for multi-step operations**
6. **Add proper error handling**
7. **Use context for request-scoped data**
8. **Add tests for critical paths**
